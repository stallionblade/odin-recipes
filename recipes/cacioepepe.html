    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Literally “cheese and pepper,” this minimalist cacio e pepe recipe is like a stripped-down mac and cheese.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>6 oz. pasta (such as egg tagliolini, bucatini, or spaghetti)</li>
        <li>1 tsp. freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>0.5 cup finely grated Pecorino</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li><p>In a pan just wide enough to hold the pasta, place enough water to fill the pan 1 inch from the bottom. Season the water with a pinch of salt and bring to a boil. Spread the pasta in the pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking together. Allow the pasta water to reduce; do not add more, as you want the starchy water to be minimal when the remaining ingredients are added.</p></li>
        <li><p>Meanwhile, add the coarse black pepper to a separate small pan over medium heat. Toast a minute or two until fragrant.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once the pasta is al dente and the pasta water has reduced so only a slight coating remains at the bottom of the pan, turn off the heat and add the toasted ground black pepper and Pecorino-Romano. Stir and toss vigorously until both ingredients are well incorporated into the pasta.</p></li>

    </ol>
