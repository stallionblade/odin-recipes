    <h3>Description</h3>    

    <p>This comforting, creamy tomato soup from Seattle chef Tom Douglas comes together quickly and easily by using a few pantry staples, such as canned whole tomatoes, garlic, onion, and extra-virgin olive oil. </p>
    <p>Dried seasonings like crushed red pepper flakes, celery seeds, oregano, salt, and pepper deepen the flavors of the soup, which comes together in just 30 minutes.</p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
        <li>5 cups canned whole tomatoes in their juice (from three 14-ounce cans)</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2/3 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon celery seed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>Four 3/4-inch-thick slices of white country bread, crusts trimmed, bread cut into 3/4-inch dice</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li><p>In a large saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Add the sliced onion and smashed garlic and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their juice, the water, heavy cream, sugar, crushed red pepper, celery seed and oregano and season with salt and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil over high heat, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Reduce the heat to moderate and simmer for 10 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Meanwhile in a small skillet, cook the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter over moderately high heat until it begins to brown, about 1 minute. Scrape the browned butter into a medium bowl. Add the olive oil to the skillet. Add the diced bread and cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until it is slightly browned, about 6 minutes. Transfer the bread to the browned butter and toss well.</p></li>
        <li><p>Working in batches, transfer the tomato soup to a blender and puree until smooth. Return the soup to a clean pot and rewarm the soup if necessary. Season the soup with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with the croutons.</p></li>
