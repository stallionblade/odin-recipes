Recipes website for The Odin Project curriculum

This is the first project in the Odin Project curriculum. This creates a simple HTML page with little CSS, the idea being that you get comfortable with basic HTML document creation. I've practiced this before, but this is the first time I'll be making it from the get go, so that will be nice. I'm looking forward to it. Ha ha.
